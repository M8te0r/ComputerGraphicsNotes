we show that discrete (local) integrability of a symmetric frame field on a tetrahedral volume mesh can be expressed as `linear constraints` on `certain tensor representations of the field` (where the entries of these tensors are polynomials in the natural representation of a frame field, as 9 DOFs per point).
